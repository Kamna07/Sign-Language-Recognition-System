# Sign-Language-Recognition-System

The only way the speech and hearing impaired (i.e dumb and deaf) people can communicate is by sign language. The main problem of this way of communication is normal people who cannot understand sign language canâ€™t communicate with these people or vice versa. My project aims to bridge the gap between the speech and hearing impaired people and the normal people. The basic idea of this project is to make a system using which dumb people can significantly communicate with all other people using their normal gestures.

The project uses image processing system to identify, especially English alphabetic sign language used by the deaf people to communicate and converts them into text so that normal people can understand.The idea may be implemented using a simple web camera and a computer system. The web camera captures the gesture image with a resolution of 320x240 pixels. The captured image is then processed for recognition purpose.
